          With their built-in grooming tools (teeth,tongue, and paws), your
          feline is well-equipped to tackle its own hair care needs. But if it
          is very dirty or gets into something sticky or smelly, you may need to
          give it a bath. Follow these steps to ensure less stress and most
          effective.

        <h2>Brushing Your Cat</h2>

        <p>
          Brushing your cat not only removes dirt, grease and dead hair from
          it's coat, but it helps to remove skin flakes and stimulates blood
          circulation, improving the overall condition of it's skin. One or two
          brushings per week will help your kitty to keep a healthy coat and
          you’ll find that regular sessions are especially beneficial when your
          cat ages and is no longer able to groom so meticulously on her own.
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>
              * For short-haired cats: With a metal comb, work the brush through
              your cat’s fur from head to tail to remove dirt and debris. Work
              along the lie of her fur, brushing in the direction the coat
              grows. Brush all over it's body, including her chest and abdomen,
              concentrating on one section at a time to remove dead hair and
              tangles. A rubber brush can be especially effective for removing
              dead hair on cats with short fur.

            <td>
              * For long-haired cats: Long-haired cats who live indoors shed
              throughout the year and need grooming sessions every few days to
              remove dead hair and prevent tangles. Start with their abdomen and
              legs, gently combing the fur upward toward her head. Comb the neck
              fur upward, toward their chin. Make a part down the middle of her
              tail and gently brush out the fur on either side. You can sprinkle
              talcum powder over knots and gently use your fingers to tease them
              apart. If the knots don’t come out by hand, try using a
              mat-splitter.
